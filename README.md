# Lending Club Case Study
You work for a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company must decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
The case study contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
- 15% of the loans have been charged off or defaulted
- Most of these loans have been defaulted after paying less than 20% of the principal due
- Higher the interest rate, higher is the tendency for loan to be defaulted
- A loan to income ratio of 0.12 is a sweet spot i.e. lesser number of defaults
- More the number of inquiries in last 6 months, higher the percentage of defaults compared to the total loans for that number of inquiries
- Loans taken for purpose of wedding or cars tend to have lower number of default as a percentage of the total loans taken for that purpose
- Highest number of loans taken for debt reconciliation and credit cards
- TX state has lesser number of defaults
